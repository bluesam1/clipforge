- ✅ **Timeline View Implementation**: Complete timeline functionality with playhead, zoom, and interaction
- ✅ **Timeline Context**: State management for timeline position, zoom, and playback
- ✅ **Timeline Components**: ClipBlock, TimeMarkers, EmptyState, Playhead components
- ✅ **Timeline-Video Sync**: Basic synchronization between timeline and video preview
- ✅ **Infinite Loop Fix**: Resolved circular update issues between timeline and video
- ✅ **PRD Enhancement**: Updated 04-video-preview-prd.md with multi-clip playback specifications

## Current System State

### Completed Components
- **Main Process** (`src/main.ts`): Window management, IPC handlers, FFmpeg integration
- **Preload Script** (`src/preload.ts`): Secure IPC bridge with TypeScript types
- **React App** (`src/App.tsx`): Full UI with video import, timeline, and preview
- **UI Components**: Fully functional video import, timeline, and export components
- **State Management**: MediaLibraryContext + TimelineContext with video clip and timeline management
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg integration with metadata extraction
- **Build System**: Vite + Electron Forge + Tailwind CSS v4 working perfectly
- **Timeline System**: Complete timeline view with playhead, zoom, and clip positioning
- **Timeline Components**: Modular components for clips, markers, playhead, and empty state

### Working Features
- ✅ Application launches without errors
- ✅ IPC communication fully functional
- ✅ Video import via file picker and drag-drop
- ✅ FFmpeg metadata extraction (duration, resolution, FPS, codec, file size)
- ✅ Video preview with working video playback (local file access enabled)
- ✅ Timeline displaying imported video clips with metadata
- ✅ Clean UI with native video controls (removed redundant external controls)
- ✅ Hot reload in development
- ✅ Production packaging successful
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 styling system
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean (0 errors)
- ✅ Security: Context isolation, CSP headers, node integration disabled
- ✅ Timeline playhead navigation and interaction
- ✅ Timeline zoom controls (zoom in, zoom out, zoom to fit)
- ✅ Timeline click-to-scrub functionality
- ✅ Timeline state persistence with localStorage
- ✅ Timeline-video preview synchronization
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, spacebar)
- ✅ Timeline component modularity (ClipBlock, TimeMarkers, Playhead, EmptyState)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Security Model**: Context isolation enabled, secure IPC bridge
- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development, Electron Forge for packaging
- **State Management**: React Context API (MediaLibraryContext for video clips)
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg via fluent-ffmpeg wrapper
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme configuration
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript 5.4.0 with strict mode and proper error handling

```

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Multi-Clip Playback**: Implement seamless switching between multiple clips during playback
2. **Timeline-Preview Sync**: Enhance synchronization to prevent circular updates and stuttering
3. **Clip Sequence Management**: Create timeline sequence utilities for mapping timeline time to clip time
4. **Gap Handling**: Implement UI feedback for gaps between clips
5. **Video Export**: Implement FFmpeg export functionality

### Development Environment
- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Node**: npm 10.9.3
- **TypeScript**: 5.4.0 (updated from 4.5.4)
- **Editor**: Cursor with AI assistance
- **Git**: Repository initialized, commits ready

### Testing Status
- ✅ Application launches successfully
- ✅ No console errors during startup
- ✅ IPC communication fully functional
- ✅ Video import (file picker + drag-drop) working
- ✅ FFmpeg metadata extraction working
- ✅ Timeline displays imported clips
- ✅ Video preview shows metadata
- ✅ Hot reload functional
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean (0 errors)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 styling working
- ✅ ESLint clean (only expected warnings)

## Next Phase Planning

### Multi-Clip Playback Requirements (04-video-preview-prd.md)
- Seamless switching between multiple clips during playback
- Timeline-to-clip time mapping for accurate positioning
- Gap handling between clips with appropriate UI feedback
- Prevention of circular update loops between timeline and preview
- Dynamic video source switching based on timeline position
- Clip sequence management in MediaLibraryContext

### Implementation Approach
1. Create timeline sequence utilities for time mapping
2. Enhance MediaLibraryContext with clip sequence state
3. Update VideoPreview for dynamic clip switching
4. Implement gap handling UI
5. Add seamless seeking across clip boundaries

### Success Criteria for Next Phase
- Multiple clips play sequentially without interruption
- Timeline position accurately maps to correct clip and time
- No stuttering or circular update loops
- Gaps between clips show appropriate empty state
- Seeking works smoothly across clip boundaries
- Video preview switches clips seamlessly during playback
