## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Security Model**: Context isolation enabled, secure IPC bridge
- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development, Electron Forge for packaging
- **State Management**: React Context API (MediaLibraryContext for video clips)
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg via fluent-ffmpeg wrapper
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme configuration
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript 5.4.0 with strict mode and proper error handling

### Current Architecture
