# Tasks: 01 - Foundation & Setup

## Relevant Files

- `src/main.ts` - Main Electron process entry point for window management and IPC handlers
- `src/renderer.tsx` - React application entry point for the renderer process
- `src/preload.ts` - Preload script for secure IPC communication between main and renderer
- `src/App.tsx` - Main React component with basic UI layout and placeholder components
- `src/index.css` - Global styles and basic responsive design
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and build scripts
- `forge.config.ts` - Electron Forge configuration for packaging
- `vite.main.config.ts` - Vite configuration for main process bundling
- `vite.renderer.config.ts` - Vite configuration for renderer process bundling
- `vite.preload.config.ts` - Vite configuration for preload script bundling
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration for type safety

### Notes

- This is the foundational layer that all other features will build upon
- Focus on security with context isolation and proper preload script implementation
- Ensure hot reload works during development for efficient iteration
- Window size should be 1200x800 pixels minimum with standard OS title bar
