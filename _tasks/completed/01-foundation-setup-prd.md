# 01 - Foundation & Setup - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview

This feature establishes the core Electron application foundation for ClipForge, including window management, IPC communication structure, and basic UI layout. This is the foundational layer that all other features will build upon.

**Goal:** Create a stable Electron application that can launch, display a basic UI, and establish communication between main and renderer processes.

## Goals

1. Set up Electron + React project structure
2. Create application window with proper security settings
3. Implement IPC communication framework
4. Display placeholder UI components
5. Ensure application launches without errors

## User Stories

**US-001: Launch Desktop Application**
- As a video creator, I want to launch ClipForge as a native desktop application so that I can access video editing tools locally without a web browser.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - App launches from system applications folder or executable
  - Application window opens with main interface
  - No console errors on startup
  - Launch time < 5 seconds

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must create an Electron main process that manages the application window
2. The system must create a renderer process with React application
3. The system must implement context isolation for security
4. The system must establish IPC communication between main and renderer processes
5. The system must display a basic UI layout with placeholder components
6. The system must handle window events (close, minimize, maximize)
7. The system must include preload script for secure IPC communication
8. The system must support hot reload during development

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Video import functionality
- Timeline components
- Video preview
- Any editing features
- Export functionality

## Design Considerations

- Window size: 1200x800 pixels minimum
- Title bar: Standard OS title bar
- Layout: Header, main content area, footer structure
- Placeholder components: ImportButton, Timeline, VideoPreview, ExportButton
- Responsive design: Basic responsive behavior

## Technical Considerations

- Use Electron 26.x or newer
- Enable context isolation
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper preload script for IPC
- Set up Vite for development and build
- Configure electron-builder for packaging

## Success Metrics

- Application launches successfully on target OS
- No console errors during startup
- IPC communication works between processes
- Basic UI renders correctly
- Development hot reload functions

## Open Questions

- Should we include a splash screen during startup?
- What should be the default window state (maximized, normal)?
- Do we need any specific security policies for file access?

## Data Flow Integration

This feature establishes the foundation for all data flows:
- **Main Process**: Window management, IPC handlers, file system access
- **Renderer Process**: React UI, user interactions, state management
- **IPC Bridge**: Secure communication channel between processes

The foundation must support the data flows defined in the main PRD:
- Import flow (IPC: import-video)
- Playback flow (renderer-only)
- Trim flow (renderer-only)
- Export flow (IPC: export-video, export-progress, export-complete)
