# 04 - Video Preview & Playback - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview

This feature provides video preview functionality with playback controls, allowing users to watch their imported video clips and see the current frame at the playhead position. It enables real-time preview of the edit sequence.

**Goal:** Enable users to preview video content with smooth playback controls and synchronized audio/video display.

## Goals

1. Display video preview at current playhead position
2. Implement play/pause controls
3. Synchronize video with timeline playhead
4. Provide smooth playback experience
5. Support keyboard shortcuts for playback

## User Stories

**US-006: Preview Video Content**
- As a user, I want to watch my video clips in a preview window so that I can see the current frame at the playhead position.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Preview window displays video at playhead position
  - Preview updates when playhead moves
  - Video renders at reasonable quality
  - Preview window has defined dimensions

**US-007: Play/Pause Video**
- As a user, I want to play and pause the timeline so that I can watch my edit in real-time.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Play button starts playback from current playhead
  - Pause button stops playback
  - Playhead advances during playback
  - Audio plays synchronized with video
  - Spacebar keyboard shortcut works

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must display a video preview window with defined dimensions
2. The system must show video content at the current playhead position
3. The system must update preview when playhead moves (scrubbing)
4. The system must provide play and pause buttons
5. The system must advance playhead during playback
6. The system must play audio synchronized with video
7. The system must support spacebar keyboard shortcut for play/pause
8. The system must maintain video quality during preview
9. The system must handle video seeking smoothly
10. The system must show loading state when switching clips

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Video editing controls
- Timeline editing functionality
- Multiple video previews
- Video effects or filters
- Frame-by-frame navigation
- Audio waveform display

## Design Considerations

- Preview window: 16:9 aspect ratio, minimum 640x360
- Playback controls: Standard play/pause buttons
- Loading states: Spinner or placeholder during video loading
- Responsive: Scale with window size
- Keyboard shortcuts: Spacebar for play/pause

## Technical Considerations

- Use HTML5 video element for preview
- Implement requestAnimationFrame for smooth playhead updates
- Handle video loading and error states
- Use video.currentTime for seeking
- Implement proper cleanup on component unmount
- Handle different video formats and codecs

## Success Metrics

- Video preview updates smoothly during scrubbing
- Playback maintains 30fps minimum
- Audio and video stay synchronized
- Keyboard shortcuts work reliably
- Video quality is acceptable for preview

## Open Questions

- Should we support fullscreen preview?
- What's the minimum video resolution we should handle?
- Should we show video metadata in the preview area?
- How should we handle videos with different aspect ratios?

## Data Flow Integration

This feature implements the **Playback Flow** from the main data flow:

```
User → Renderer: Click Play Button
Renderer → Renderer: Start Playback Loop
loop Every Frame (requestAnimationFrame)
    Renderer → Renderer: Update Playhead Position
    Renderer → Renderer: Update VideoPreview currentTime
    Renderer → Renderer: Render Playhead on Timeline
end
User → Renderer: Click Pause / Spacebar
Renderer → Renderer: Stop Playback Loop
```

**Key Components:**
- VideoPreview component (main preview display)
- PlaybackControls component (play/pause buttons)
- PlayerContext (playback state management)
- Video element integration (HTML5 video)

**State Management:**
- PlayerContext for playback state (playing, currentTime)
- TimelineContext integration for playhead position
- Real-time synchronization between preview and timeline
